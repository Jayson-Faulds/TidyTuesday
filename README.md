# TidyTuesday
This repo is for my R scripts that I create for the weekly TidyTuesday series held by RStudio. If you don't know what that is, every week the RStudio staff releases a dataset with an accompanying article and documentation regarding a certian topic (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). The data is somewhat cleaned by the staff, but not fully. As a participant, I download the data, do my own data cleaning, and then make some kind of visual and post it to Twitter @TidyTuesday.

I'm hoping that as I continue to do these weekly challenges, my data wrangling and data visualization skills in R will get better.
